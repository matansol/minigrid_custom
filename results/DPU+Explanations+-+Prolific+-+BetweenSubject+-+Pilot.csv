The avatar's view is limited, and it can only see what is in front of it and 3 blocks to each side; out-of-view cells appear darker.

Example images:






 
By turning, the view will also change and let the avatar see different parts of the grid 


 
When the avatar is facing a ball, like we see in the upper example, it can collect the ball using the Key ‘1’.

Right arrow (→)  Turn the avatar to ITS right

Key ‘1’ – Pick up a ball directly in front of the avatar


To get a better understanding of the environment and the game, you will play the game yourself.
In the link below, you need to play at least 3 rounds of the game.

In this section, an AI agent will control the avatar in the game for five rounds.

The agent is imperfect—it may make mistakes or choose suboptimal actions.

Your task is to train the agent to improve its performance: the better it performs by the end of the five rounds, the greater your reward.

In each round, you will first observe the agent controlling the avatar. Afterwards, you will proceed to the Round Overview Page, where you can provide feedback by correcting the agent’s poor decisions.
 



 

Use the Previous and Next Action buttons to step through the agent’s most recent round, one action at a time. 

When you identify a poor action, click its label (e.g., “forward”) and select a better alternative.
You can only correct actions on the agent’s most recent path. For example, in the image above, the correction would be ""turn right"" to avoid the lava.

 
Correct the agent on each mistake it made along the path—the more corrections you provide, the better the training will be.

 



If you revise the same action more than once, only your final selection will take effect.

 

After selecting a correction, it will be highlighted with a blue background, and a white symbol will appear on the avatar to indicate the newly selected action. 

In this example, we want to tell the agent not to step into the lava, so we selected the ‘turn right’ action instead, toward the blue ball.




 

 

	When you finish submitting your feedback, click Update Agent to help the agent learn from your corrections and adjust its strategy.
